## 💡 Key SQL Queries

### Q1: Total Number of Transactions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM bank_transactions;
-- Result: 100K transactions
```

### Q2: Total Credit Amount
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(amount)/1000000, 2) AS total_credit_M
FROM bank_transactions
WHERE transaction_type = 'Credit';
-- Result: 127.60M
```

### Q3: Total Debit Amount
```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(amount)/1000000, 2) AS total_debit_M
FROM bank_transactions
WHERE transaction_type = 'Debit';
-- Result: 127.29M
```

### Q4: Net Transaction Amount
```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type='Credit' 
        THEN amount ELSE -amount END)
    /1000000, 2) AS net_transaction_M
FROM bank_transactions;
-- Result: 0.32M
```

### Q5: Account Activity Ratio
```sql
SELECT account_number,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) / AVG(balance), 4) AS activity_ratio
FROM bank_transactions
GROUP BY account_number;
-- Result: 50K accounts analyzed
```

### Q6: Transactions Per Month
```sql
SELECT YEAR(transaction_date) AS year,
    MONTH(transaction_date) AS month,
    CONCAT(ROUND(COUNT(*)/1000, 1), 'K') 
    AS transactions_per_month
FROM bank_transactions
GROUP BY year, month;
-- Result: 8.5K - 9.3K transactions per month
```

### Q7: Total Transaction Amount by Branch
```sql
SELECT branch, 
    CONCAT('₹', ROUND(SUM(amount)/1000000, 2), 'M') 
    AS total_amount
FROM bank_transactions
GROUP BY branch;
-- Result: City Center ₹42.91M | Main ₹42.84M
--         East ₹42.70M | Suburban ₹42.18M
--         North ₹41.68M | Downtown ₹42.59M
```

### Q8: Transaction Volume by Bank
```sql
SELECT bank_name, 
    CONCAT('₹', ROUND(SUM(amount)/1000000, 2), 'M') 
    AS total_amount
FROM bank_transactions
GROUP BY bank_name;
-- Result: Axis ₹42.71M | Kotak ₹42.83M
--         ICICI ₹42.52M | PNB ₹42.37M

```

### Q9: Transaction Method Distribution
```sql
SELECT transaction_method, 
    CONCAT(ROUND(COUNT(*)/1000, 2), 'K') 
    AS total_transactions
FROM bank_transactions
GROUP BY transaction_method;
-- Result: Credit Card: 33.31K
--         Bank Transfer: 33.34K
--         Debit Card: 33.35K
```

### Q10: High-Risk Transaction Flag
```sql
SELECT is_high_risk, 
    CONCAT(ROUND(COUNT(*)/1000, 2), 'K') AS total_count,
    CONCAT('₹', ROUND(SUM(amount)/1000000, 2), 'M') 
    AS total_value
FROM bank_transactions
GROUP BY is_high_risk;
-- Result: High-Risk: 81.57K = ₹244.72M
--         Normal: 18.43K = ₹10.16M
```

### Q11: Suspicious Transaction Frequency
```sql
SELECT CONCAT(ROUND(COUNT(*)/1000, 2), 'K') 
    AS suspicious_transactions
FROM bank_transactions
WHERE is_high_risk = 1;
-- Result: 81.57K suspicious transactions
```

### Q12: Credit-Debit Summary View
```sql
CREATE VIEW vw_credit_debit_summary AS
SELECT 
    CONCAT('₹', ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type='Credit'

        AS total_credit,
    CONCAT('₹', ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type='Debit'
